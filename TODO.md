# To do

* Better distance estimation. Poisson model sucks
* Model chosen by input type. Right now assuming protein alignments, but could be DNA alignments too.
* When two sequence do not share columns or they are completely different, I
  default to distance 2.5. This is not good in all models (like Poisson!).
